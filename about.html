<h1>About</h1>

<p>
I am the author of <em>The Illuminated Path</em> and a guide for those seeking a deeper relationship with their body, emotions, and inner intelligence.
</p>

<p>
Modern life has trained us to override the body rather than understand it. We are taught to suppress pain, silence discomfort, and distrust our own sensations. Over time, this disconnection creates deeper imbalance.
</p>

<p>
My work invites a different relationship. One rooted in listening, awareness, and respect for the body’s signals.
</p>

<p>
This work complements medical care. It restores agency, presence, and trust in the intelligence that already lives within you.
